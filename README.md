# All the Favorites

It's an app for creating lists of your favorite things. It was inspired by me making a list of all my favorite random pop culture things and realizing that I could not CTRL + F on paper to see if I already added something. I plan to integrate three different API's that will allow users to add anime, movies, and games to their favorites and store them in a mongo database.
